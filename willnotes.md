don't bother with the flux modules 9 and 10- go straight to the new course!
======================
html should be a projection of app state, not a source of truth
html and js in the same file!
unidirectional flow is easier
inline styles can be good
 
 
 commonjs pattern
 1 get ref
 var dependency = require ("hhgs")
 2 declare
 var mymode{
 //code here
 }
 
3 expose to others
module.exports = my module;


react router!
fb created jest which is their wrapper of jasmin testing framework
 
jsx is just an abstraction over js calls

angular ember knockoutjs etc
put js in html
react puts html in js which makes more sense!

no explicit interface between html and js

virtual dom compares current state to desired state and updates accordingly.  Think photographer's assistant
